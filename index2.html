    <h2><strong>Brief History of Electric Power</strong></h2>

      * Ancient observations (600 BCE+): People noticed static electricity—like
      amber attracting dust after rubbing. <br />
      * 1600s-1700s (early science):Researchers began studying electricity
      systematically. Benjamin Franklin (1752) helped show lightning is
      electrical, popularizing ideas about charge. <br />
      * 1800 (first steady source): Alessandro Volta created the voltaic pile,
      the first practical battery, providing continuous electric current. <br />
      * 1830s-1840s (power generation begins): Michael Faraday discovered
      electromagnetic induction, the key principle behind generators and
      transformers—how motion becomes electricity. <br />
      *Late 1800s (electric lighting + power systems):

      Thomas Edison promoted direct current (DC) systems and built early power
      stations (like Pearl Street in New York, 1882). Nikola Tesla and George
      Westinghouse advanced alternating current (AC), which could be stepped
      up/down with transformers and transmitted long distances more efficiently.
      This led to large-scale electrification and the “War of the Currents.”
      Early to mid 1900s (grids expand): Cities and industries electrified
      rapidly; later, rural electrification programs extended power lines to
      farms and small towns. Regional grids began interconnecting for
      reliability. Mid to late 1900s (new sources + long-distance transmission):
      Electricity generation diversified: coal, hydro, natural gas, and later
      nuclear. High-voltage transmission and HVDC lines improved long-distance
      power delivery. 2000s to today (clean energy + smart grids): Rapid growth
      of wind and solar, better batteries, and smart grid tech (sensors,
      automation) to balance variable renewables and improve efficiency and
      outage response.

      Electric power evolved from early discoveries about static electricity to
      practical systems that generate and deliver electricity. In 1800, Volta’s
      battery provided the first steady electric current. In the 1830s,
      Faraday’s work on electromagnetic induction made generators possible. By
      the late 1800s, Edison’s DC systems and Tesla/Westinghouse’s AC systems
      helped launch large-scale electrification, with AC becoming best for
      long-distance transmission. In the 1900s, interconnected power grids
      expanded to cities and rural areas and added new energy sources like hydro
      and nuclear. Today, electric power increasingly relies on renewables like
      wind and solar, supported by smarter grids and energy storage.
